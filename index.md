## About Me

I'm a 3rd(final) year  <a href="http://english.eco.hust.edu.cn/Program/Master_Program.htm" target="_blank"> Economics </a> Master's student at <a href="https://english.hust.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> Huazhong University of Science and technology</a>'s <a href="http://english.eco.hust.edu.cn/" target="_blank">  School of Economics</a>,
working under the mentorship of Prof.<a href="https://faculty.hust.edu.cn/yangjin1/zh_CN/more/869776/shjzgd/" target="_blank"> Jin Yang</a>. I am in the process of applying for a Ph.D. program that will commence in fall 2024 or a later term.

Prior to joining the Master program, I completed my bachelar's degree in Investment Science from <a href="https://www.cornell.edu" target = "_blank"> Sichuan Agricultural University</a> advised by Prof. <a href= "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Houjian-Li" target = "_blank"> Houjian Li</a>.  


Starting from 2020, I have been involved in various rural surveys. I am deeply interested in rural development, issues of inequality, and I enjoy going out into the field to observe the problems that communities need to address.

Outside of academia,  I'm also passionate about marathon, hiking, and Chinese calligraphy. I enjoy photography, and can use Photoshop (PS) and Premiere (PR) to edit both photos and videos.
